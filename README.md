# ALGORITMA GENETIKA UNTUK PENYELESAIAN PERMASALAHAN ALOKASI DOSEN PEMBIMBING TESIS

A repository of my final thesis in college as a computer science student major
My thesis is in Indonesia language and use pyhton as a main language in the research program.
Feel free to use it as a reference, but don't forget to mention my work in your reference or in your quotes. I really work hard on this, really appreciate your honesty and also remember, PLAGIARISM IS A CRIME

### Abstract
Based on the 2017’s Curriculum Documents of the Masters Program (S2), 
students of the Department of Computer Science and Electronics of Universitas 
Gadjah Mada, to be able to graduate and obtain M.Cs. degree must be able to 
complete a thesis as one of the compulsory subjects.
In the thesis registration 2018/2019 period in even semester and 2018/2019 
period even semester, there are around 54% of the thesis supervisors proposed by 
students exceeding the available lecturer quota. In the results of the decision of the 
both period’s lecturer supervisors assignment meeting, only 14% of students 
received a supervisor with a field of interest that matched the topic of the thesis 
taken. This study aims to resolve the issue of the allocation of the thesis supervisor 
which can be used as a suggested solution in the decisions making of the thesis 
supervisor assignment meeting by using genetic algorithm.
This research has been able to produce a valid solution with a percentage of 
compatibility in the field of lecturer’s research and students reach 31% for the 
proposed assignment of supervisors in the 2018/2019 period even semester and 
reach 33% for the 2019/2020 period even semester.
Keywords : Genetic algorithm, metaheuristic, resource allocation problem
